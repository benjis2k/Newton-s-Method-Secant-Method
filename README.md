# Newton's Method and Secant Method for Root Finding

This project demonstrates the implementation of Newton's Method and the Secant Method for finding roots of nonlinear equations using Python. The code includes:

- **Newton's Method:**  
  An iterative algorithm that uses the function and its derivative to quickly converge to a root. The code provides both a numerical implementation and an animated visualization of the method's geometric interpretation.

- **Secant Method:**  
  An alternative root-finding algorithm that does not require the derivative of the function. It uses two initial guesses and approximates the derivative using a secant line.

## Features

- Clear function definitions for the target function and its derivative.
- Step-by-step implementation of both Newton's and Secant methods.
- Animated visualization of Newton's method using Matplotlib.
- Convergence analysis and informative printouts for each method.

## Usage

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `Newtons Method.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the notebook cells to see the methods in action and view the animation.

## Example Output

The notebook will print the root found, the value of the function at the root, and the number of iterations for both methods. The Newton's method section also displays an animated plot showing the convergence process.
