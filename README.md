# Newton-s-Method-Secant-Method
This code demonstrates Newton's method and the Secant method for finding roots of nonlinear equations. It defines the functions, implements both algorithms, and visualizes Newton's method with an animation. The code also prints the root found, the function value at the root, and the number of iterations.
